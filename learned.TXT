Rem and max-width

Max-width: If the width is less than max-width then, it becomes acc to the parent container, 


rem: root element font-size {HTML element }

 1rem = 16px  By default  -> if you set max-width : 50rem; then max-width: 800px; 

 use 10px by default for HTML but to have the user good interaction  do it in percentage like font-size: 62.5%; to respect user's demands.
